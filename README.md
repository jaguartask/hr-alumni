## Usage
Users start by registering for the site by signin in with their GitHub profile. If they are not  affiliated with Hack Reactor or HR Remote Beta on GitHub, then they will be restricted from signing up. (People affiliated with those organizations who have trouble singing in should make sure their affiliation on GitHub is public and not private.)

Once registered, users confirm their profile information, including links to projects they have worked on. Their profile is then available for potential employers to browse. Alumni can also take advantage of the job tracker tool, which helps them keep track of each phase of the process in applying for a job, and they can communicate with each other on a message board. The messsage board is intended to be a place where alumni can share information about job openings and connections.

Employers wishing to browse the site simply go to the homepage, click to enter the employers section of the application, and then they can browse and filter profiles.
